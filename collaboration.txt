present. Created printstack function

Aided in writing functions, aided in conceptually understanding what 
functions are doing what. created lots of the math functions.
Fixed few issues with output. 
Added a personal take on the best whitespace.

by one errors. Found good formatting for the print statements.

small modifications over the file.
